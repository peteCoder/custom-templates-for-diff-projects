        answer: "You will be charged based on the plan pricing. If the paid plan includes 300 order then you will be charged for the orders excluding the 300 orders. For example if you do 400 orders in the US and Canada, you have to pay $10 as 300 orders will be excluded and you are paying for 100 orders. For other countries, please check our global pricing. We have lower cost plan available in many countries.",
